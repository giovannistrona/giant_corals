To replicate the analyses in the paper, you will need to first run the main.py script. The script includes code and instructions to download the climate and bathymetry data needed by the analyses.
The script will produce two output files, named giant_sites_time_series.csv and giant_sites_time_series_future.csv.
These files will serve as input to the script make_plots.R, which will produce all the graphs and maps shown in the paper.
